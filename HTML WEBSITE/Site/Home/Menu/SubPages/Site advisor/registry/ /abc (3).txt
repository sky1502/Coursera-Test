natural beauty is here 
what a beauty oh dear
i will love u anywhere
will never abandon u dnt fear

ur love is in the air
i can feel it everywhere
dnt leave me i fear
i cannot live alone dear

i need u in my lyf 
i need u as my wife
i need u anyhow 
i can even give u my lyf

without u i'm alone
but wid  u i feel at home
u r d one i desire 
only u i admire

if u hrt me i dnt care
if u kill me i dnt fear
but dnt hate me i do care
dnt leave me i do care

oh my love never cry
oh my love never ever try
i feel like torned when u cry
so i'll stop u whenever u try

frnship lyk urs is nvr to b found
luv lyk urs can nvr be found
u r so unique and astound
i'll fight any hound to keep u safe n sound
